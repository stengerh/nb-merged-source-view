This is a proof of concept for [[80cat] merge files of package into a logical view][bug].

Disclaimer:

* Only works for Maven projects.
* No dynamic updates, i.e. does not react to changed settings or added/removed/renamed source files or directories.
* This is a good example of why merging node hierarchies is a bad idea.
